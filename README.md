Notes and stuff about ReactJS and related things

# `npm` modules
Following are the bare minimum `npm` modules required:

```sh
$ npm install --save react react-dom
```

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react css-loader style-loader html-webpack-plugin webpack webpack-dev-server
```

# Notes
- Instead of creating custom classes, Components can be creating by using pure functions
- `PropTypes` helps to validate the types passed to Components
